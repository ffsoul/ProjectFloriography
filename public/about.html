        <h1>ABOUT</h1>
        <p>Hyacinth Asparas chose to apply for a magnet school to get a fresh start in high school. Despite this, it seemed to her like it was just going to be the same as it's always been - another year of monotony.</p>

        <p>As she was ready to accept her school life, a mysterious new student arrives to steal her heart.</p>
        
        <p>"Let's discover what it means to love. Together."</p>

        <!-- <div id="authorBlurb">
            <p>The author, <strong>Hilda Terry</strong>, became the first woman allowed to join the National Cartoonists Society, upon which she lobbied for other women cartoonists to join, such as <strong>Mopsy</strong> author <strong>Gladys Parker.</strong></p> 
            <p>She also held a firm belief that she was a reincarnation of <strong>Dorcas Good</strong>, a child imprisoned after being accused of practicing witchcraft in the 1692 Salem witch trials.</p>
            <p>Say what you will, but the lady's got range!</p>

        <h1>SETTING</h1>
        <p>Project Floriography takes place in a country that could be America but not really. Expect Japanese rom-com tropes mixed with the life of a high school student in the 2020s. </p>
